# circleOfSquares

I am learning Python more in depth so I can better teach students as a Teacher Assistant during school. And because of my interest in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. 
This was my first program doing some kind of generative art using "import turtle". It forms a really cool visual of some colorful circles using squares only.
